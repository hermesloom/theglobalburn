# The Global Burn

Hosting a burn for everybody.

Initially for [The Borderland](https://theborderland.se), but designed to be as general, configurable and parameterizable as possible.

## TODO

- allow changing name and birthday (only admins can change)
  - users can *apply* for a change of name and/or birthday, auto-accept with small Levenshtein distance
- allow search for memberships (both email and name)
- when refunding a membership, deduct Stripe fees
- generate and send out membership QR PDF via email
- link list (both on theborderland.se and in another section besides the timeline overview)
- membership scanner

## Long-term goals

- consolidating existing tools
  - add the entire dreams system (including receipt submission), i.e. everything what Cobudget and Open Collective currently do
  - add a single interface for all shift signups (clowns, sanctuary, threshold, toilets, etc.)
    - issue so far: realities leads didn't have proper contact details from everyone!
  - add a single interface for rideshares
  - integrate the map and the JOMO guide, i.e. everything what the [Dust app](https://dust.events/) currently does
  - integrate everything Talk currently does
  - add LLM-based AP writing assistance (based on the AP [How do we run Advice Processes?](https://talk.theborderland.se/d/iFKC1rD2/how-do-we-run-advice-processes-))
  - add all the functionality for [BurnerBox](https://burnerbox.glide.page/dl/search)
- technical
  - set up as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to allow seamless use on mobile
  - allow "one-click deployment" onto own server, e.g. using [Fly](https://fly.io/)
  - i18n
